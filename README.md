# CorGI_ObsTools
This repo is intended to be a resource for the Roman-Coronagraph CPP and other individuals who are interested in observation planning efforts. This repo will contain python code that can:

Query Simbad and VizieR online catalogs

Create sky coverage maps

Query downloaded catalogs

#Current Plan

Python code that can query Simbad and VizieR to identify and catalog Roman-Coronagraph calibration targets

Python code that queries polarization standards catalogs for polarization calibration targets

Python code that queries Simbad and VizieR for information on dark hole digging reference stars

Python code that will build database information for calibration targets and dark hole digging reference stars

Python code that will create sky coverage maps for targets of interest after applying proper motion to epoch J2027
